There was once a short man with dark hair named john. john worked as a server at a restaraunt, using his meager earners to support his alcoholism. He had been doing this well on 5 years now and was starting to its toll on his body

 One day, on his regularly scheduled trip to his local bar, he got a call from a number he didn't recognize. He shrugged, turned the ringer off on his phone and flagged the bartender down for another drink. Almost immediately after his drink was placed in front of him, he received a call from the same unknown number. This time, John hesitantly answered the call.
"Sir," the voice began. "Are you happy with your long distance service?" it continued. John sighed in exasperation. "Have you considered satellite television?" the voice said as it's owner carried on.
